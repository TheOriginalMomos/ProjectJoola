# ProjectJoola
This is a small student project realized in my last semester at UQAC.
It was created by a team of 4 students :
- 3 programmers : MichaÃ«l Lavoie, Alex Fortin and Carl Grenier (me)
- 1 level designer : Vincent Guilmoteau

The project lasted 4 months.

# Note
None of the assets in the project were created by us, these were bought on various sites since we had no 3D artists available for this project.

Not all the code and/or files listed here were created entirely by me. This was a team effort.

# My contribution
I worked on the following files :
- Speaker.h & .cpp
- PlayerHUD.h & .cpp (ShowPossibleInteraction methods, ShowEndScreenMenu method, ShowDeathScreenMenu method)
- Interaction.h & .cpp
- Interactable.h & .cpp
- InteractableBase.h & .cpp
- InteractableDoor.h & .cpp
- InteractableDoorLocked.h & .cpp
- InteractableLever .h & .cpp
- InteractableSwitch.h & .cpp
- InteractableThrowable.h & .cpp
- EndScreenMeny.h & .cpp
- EndGameGoal.h & .cpp

I also did the implementation of the GamepadDetection.h & .cpp (The actual classes came from another github)
